You can print the previously created string "zebra" by using the p, puts, or the print method followed by the word "animal" (without the quotation marks) which is the variable name that the string zebra is stored in

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is used to pass data from a variable into a string. In Ruby interpolation is implemented by adding the interpolation marker #{<variable>} with the variable you want to add, or interpolate, between the curly braces.

1. How do we get input from a user? What is the method that we would use?

To get input from a user we would use the gets or the gets.chomp method. The gets method gets data from the user which we can be stored into a variable for later use.

1. Name and describe two common string methods.

Two common string methods are the split method and the sub method. The split method will split a string at user defined conditions or if no condition is defined it will default to splitting the string at the spaces between words. The sub method will substitute part of a string in a single occurrence. You can also use the gsub method to globally substitute each instance of the string.
